This notebook presents different techniques on visualizing data using [folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) that allows to manipulate data in Python and then visualize it in a Leaflet map.

Data that has been analysed is about property prices in Ireland and can be downloaded from [Property Price Register offical site](https://www.propertypriceregister.ie/)

The aim was to use Folium Choropleth Map with a slider that would show how property prices have evolved month over month and what were the most expensive areas.
